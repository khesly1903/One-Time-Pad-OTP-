# One-Time-Pad-OTP-
This repository contains a Python implementation of the One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption algorithm. OTP is a theoretically unbreakable encryption method, where the key is as long as the message and used only once.

Usage:
1) Generate a random key for your message.
2) Encrypt your message using the XOR operation.
3) Decrypt the encrypted message using the same key.

Notes:
Ensure the key is kept secure and only used once, as this is essential to the security of the OTP method.
The key length must match the length of the message.
